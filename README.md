Week Eight Journal
1. Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The client, The Gaming Room, is a company that created a game called Draw It or Lose It, initially developed for Android devices. They wanted to expand their software to support multiple platforms, including web and mobile environments. The core requirements included designing a scalable, reusable system that supports multiple players and teams, ensures unique game instances, and facilitates cross-platform interaction through a web-based interface.

2. What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I did particularly well in clearly aligning the design decisions with the client’s business goals. For example, recommending a Linux-based server platform and using RESTful APIs directly supports cross-platform compatibility. I also integrated sound object-oriented design principles (like Singleton and Iterator patterns), which helped create a maintainable and scalable architecture.

3. What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
Working through the design document forced me to think deeply about the structure and logic of the application before writing a single line of code. It clarified the relationships between different components and made sure I was consistently solving the right problems. It also helped identify potential challenges—like memory management and scalability—early in the design process, rather than during implementation.

4. If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would revise the Evaluation section where different platforms are compared. While it addresses each platform’s characteristics, it could be more data-driven—perhaps including performance benchmarks or more specific deployment examples. In the future, I’d add clearer justifications tied to real-world use cases or case studies for each platform recommendation.

5. How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I interpreted the user’s needs by focusing on scalability, cross-platform accessibility, and security—each of which was directly reflected in my architectural choices. For instance, using RESTful APIs and a cloud-based database supports consistent access and storage across platforms. Considering user needs ensures the software is functional, accessible, and enjoyable. Ignoring them can lead to misaligned solutions that fail in real-world use.

6. How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I approached the design by first understanding the requirements, then modeling the domain with a UML diagram, and finally outlining the system architecture with modular components. Techniques I would reuse include:

UML modeling to visualize class relationships.
Design patterns (Singleton, Iterator) for proven architecture.
Platform evaluation to ensure compatibility.
Documentation-driven development to guide coding efforts.
In the future, I would also involve stakeholder feedback earlier and use tools like wireframes or prototypes to validate ideas quickly.
